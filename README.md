# Finding all edges on any shortest path between two given nodes of DAG using parallel computing

Implementation of the algorithm proposed in the research article **"Finding all edges on any smallest route connecting two given nodes of DAG using parallel computing"**. This artcile is accepted at the **9th International Conference on Innovations in Computer Science and Engineering (ICICSE) 2021**, Hyderabad.

The parallel version of Dijkstra's algorithm which is implemented using the adjacency list and the OpenMP is also proposed in the article **"An Autonomous Intelligent System to Leverage the PostHarvest Agricultural Process using Localization and Mapping"**. This article is accepted at the **International Conference Intelligent Systems and Sustainable Computing (ICISSC) 2021**, Hyderabad.
